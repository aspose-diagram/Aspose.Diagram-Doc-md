## Configure Shape Objects with Layers in Visio

[Aspose.Diagram for .NET](http://www.aspose.com/.net/diagram-component.aspx) allows to configure shape objects with layers in Microsoft Office Visio diagram. Each shape can belong to multiple layers so developers can manage shapes to suit end user needs. The [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/shape) class object offers `LayerMember` property which allows to add and remove shape objects to and from the layers in Visio drawing. Users can manage these properties programmatically using Aspose.Diagram API as follows:

### Configure Shape Objects Programming Sample

The following piece of code helps to add, remove and move shape object properties.

## Add a new Layer in the Visio Diagram

[Aspose.Diagram for .NET](http://www.aspose.com/.net/diagram-component.aspx) allows developers to add new layers to organize custom categories of shapes, and then assign shapes to those layers programmatically. The [LayerCollection](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/layercollection) class offers `Add` method which allows to add a new [Layer](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/layer) in the Visio drawing. Developers can set `Layer` properties by initializing its class object.

### Add Layer Programming Sample

The following piece of code helps to add `Layer` objects.

## Retrieve All Layers from the Visio Diagram

[Aspose.Diagram for .NET](http://www.aspose.com/.net/diagram-component.aspx) gives access to developers to get the existing layers of a Visio diagram. The [PageSheet](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/pagesheet) property of the [Page](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/page) class allows to retrieve the list of available layers from a Visio diagram using [LayerCollection](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/layercollection) class.

### Retrieve Layers Programming Sample

The following piece of code helps to get the list of `Layers`.

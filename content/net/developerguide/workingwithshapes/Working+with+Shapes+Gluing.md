## Get the Connectors Glued to a Particular Shape

[Add and Connect Visio Shapes](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=diagramnet&title=Add+and+Connect+Visio+Shapes&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=18350189) explains how to add a shape and connect it to other shapes in Microsoft Visio diagrams using Aspose.Diagram for .NET. It is also possible to find connectors that are glued to this shape.

### Getting Glued Shapes

The `GluedShapes` method exposed by the [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/shape) class can be used to get a list of the IDs of all the connectors glued to a shape, or, if the shape in question is a connector, the IDs of the shapes it's connected to.The `GetShape` method, exposed by the [ShapeCollection](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/shapecollection Class) class, can then be used to find a shape by its ID.

The code below shows how to:

1.  Load a sample file.
2.  Access a particular shape.
3.  Get a list of IDs of all the connectors glued to this shape.

#### Get Connectors Glued Programming Sample

Use the following code in your .NET application to find all the connectors glued to a shape using Aspose.Diagram for .NET.

## Glue Visio Shapes Together with Connection Point

Aspose.Diagram for .NET allows developers glue shapes together through the connection points.

### Glue Shapes

The `GlueShapes` method exposed by the [Page](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/page) class can be used.

The code below shows how to:

1.  Load a sample file.
2.  Glue shapes.
3.  Save diagram.

#### Glue Visio Shapes Programming Sample

Use the following code in your .NET application to glue shapes through the connection points:

## Glue Shapes Inside the Container

Aspose.Diagram for .NET enables developers to glue group shapes inside a container.

### Glue Group Shape

The `GlueShapesInContainer` method exposed by the [Page](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/page) class can be used.

**Input diagram**

**The diagram after gluing the group shapes**  
![](https://docs2.aspose.com/diagram/net/attachments/18350189/18547241.png)

The code below shows how to:

1.  Load a sample file.
2.  Glue group shapes.
3.  Save diagram.

#### Glue Shapes Inside Programming Sample

Use the following code in your .NET application to glue group shape inside a container:

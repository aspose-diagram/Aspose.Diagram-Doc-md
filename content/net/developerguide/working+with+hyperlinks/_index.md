## Add Hyperlink to a Visio Shape

Microsoft Office Visio supports adding the hyperlinks to any shape. The hyperlinks can link to another page or shape in the current drawing, a page or shape in another drawing, a document other than a Visio drawing, a Web site, FTP site, or e-mail address. Developers can use Aspose.Diagram API to easily add hyperlinks to a Visio shape.

In the multi page Visio drawing, hyperlinks can navigate you from one shape to many other types of the links. [HyperlinkCollection](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/hyperlinkcollection) exposed by the [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/shape) class offers Add method which can be used to add a shape's hyperlink.

To identify properties in Microsoft Office Visio:

1.  In a Visio diagram, right-click a shape.
2.  Select **Hyperlink.**
3.  Set existing properties
4.  Press **OK** button

### Add Hyperlink Programming Sample

The code snippet below adds shape's hyperlink data.

## Get Hyperlinks Data of the Visio Shapes

Developers can retrieve all hyperlinks from a Visio shape in the same way as they [read Visio shape data](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=diagramnet&title=Reading+Visio+Shape+Data&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=18350139) using [Aspose.Diagram for .NET API](http://www.aspose.com/.net/diagram-component.aspx)

In the multi page Visio drawing, hyperlinks can navigate you from one shape to many other types of the links. [HyperlinkCollection](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/hyperlinkcollection) exposed by the [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/shape) class allows developers to retrieve hyperlinks.

To identify properties in Microsoft Office Visio:

1.  In a diagram, right-click a shape.
2.  Select **Hyperlink.**

Any existing properties are listed in the dialog.

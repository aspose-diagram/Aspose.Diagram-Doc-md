Aspose.Diagram for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Diagram 3.8.0  

# Aspose.Diagram for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Diagram 3.8.0


This document describes changes to the Aspose.Diagram API from version 3.7.0 to 3.8.0, that may be of interest to module/application developers. It includes not only new and updated public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Diagram. 

### A new Page class constructor is added to pass max page ID

Developers can easily calculate a maximum page ID and increment it. The new Page (int ID) constructor allows you to pass the page ID. You can see an example topic about this feature: [Insert a New Blank Page into a Visio Drawing](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=diagramnet&title=Insert+a+New+Blank+Page+into+a+Visio+Drawing&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=18350104)

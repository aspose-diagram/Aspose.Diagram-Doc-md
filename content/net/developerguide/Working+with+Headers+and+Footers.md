## Manage Headers and Footers of the Visio Diagrams

[Aspose.Diagram for .NET](http://www.aspose.com/.net/diagram-component.aspx) provides a mechanism for setting headers and footers of the Microsoft Office Visio diagrams. Developers can get or set the text string that appears on the left, center and right side of a document header/footer. They can also set header and footer margin along with the font properties of the text.

### Setting Headers and Footers Properties

The [Diagram](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/diagram) class object offers `HeaderFooter` property which allows to get and set header and footer text, font and margin values. During the print preview of Visio drawing, users can click on "Edit Header & Footer" link button in Microsoft Visio 2013 (in Microsoft Visio 2010 >> "Header & Footer" button). There are a few options to add text as shown in the screenshot below. Users can manage these properties programmatically using Aspose.Diagram API as follows:

#### Programming Sample

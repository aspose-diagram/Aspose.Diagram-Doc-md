# Aspose.Diagram for .NET : Modify the Gradient of a Visio Shape


Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers can enhance the appearance of a Visio shape by modifying the properties of the gradient. Developers can retrieve a gradient fill to set the direction, angle, gradient stop color and position etc.

## Modify the Gradient Fill Programming Sample

[Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/shape) class offers Fill property which allows developers to retrieve a [GradientFill](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/gradientfill) object. The GradientFill class holds the gradient data of a Visio Shape. Developers can set all its available properties as well as retrieve a gradient stop by index to set the color and position properties.

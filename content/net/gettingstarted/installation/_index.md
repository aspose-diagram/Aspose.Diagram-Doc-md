## Installing Aspose.Diagram for .NET through NuGet

NuGet is a free, open source developer-focused package management system for the .NET platform intent on simplifying the process of incorporating third party libraries into a .NET application during development. It is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to add, remove, and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio projects that use the .NET Framework. A library or tool can easily be shared with other developers by creating a NuGet package and storing it inside a NuGet repository. When you install the package, NuGet copies files to your solution and automatically makes the necessary changes, such as adding references and changing your app.config or web.config files. If you decide to remove the library, NuGet removes files and reverses whatever changes it made to your project so that no clutter is left.

### Referencing Aspose.Diagram for .NET

Taking benefit of this wonderful feature, we have bundled [Aspose.Diagram for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Diagram) libraries into a NuGet package and uploaded it into a NuGet repository. With this option, you benefit from using Aspose.Diagram for .NET without installing this component on your system. NuGet runs in Visual Studio 2010 and higher version(s), Visual Web Developer 2010, and Windows Phone Developer Tools 7.1. In our tests, we have tested it with Visual Studio 2015 Ultimate.

## Add Hyperlink to a Visio Shape

It is an easy approach to add hyperlink to Microsoft Visio shape dynamically.

On multi page Visio drawings, hyperlinks can move you from one page to another. You also can link your drawing to a web page or a file on your system.

These properties are exposed by the [`Shape`](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/diagram/com.aspose.diagram/classes/Shape) class supports the [com.aspose.diagram.Hyperlink](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/diagram/com.aspose.diagram/classes/Hyperlink) object. The `add` method can be used to add a shape's hyperlink data.

To identify properties in Microsoft Visio:

1.  In a diagram, right-click a shape.
2.  Select **Hyperlink**.
3.  Set existing properties
4.  Press **OK** button

The code snippets below adds shape's hyperlink data.

### Add Hyperlink Programming Sample

## Get Hyperlinks Data of the Visio Shapes

It is possible to get a shape's hyperlink data in a similar way that you [reading Visio shape data](#).

Developers can retrieve all hyperlinks from a Visio shape in the same way as they [read Visio shape data](#) using [Aspose.Diagram for Java API](http://www.aspose.com/java/diagram-component.aspx)

In multipage Visio drawings, hyperlinks can move you from one page to another. You also can link your drawing to a web page or a file on your system.

These properties are exposed by the [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/diagram/com.aspose.diagram/classes/Shape) class supports the [com.aspose.diagram.Hyperlink](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/diagram/com.aspose.diagram/classes/Hyperlink) object. The property can be used to read a shape's hyperlink data.

To identify properties in Microsoft Visio:

1.  In a diagram, right-click a shape.
2.  Select **Hyperlink.**  
    Any existing properties are listed in the dialog.

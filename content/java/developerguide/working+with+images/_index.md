## Extract All Images From a Visio Page

In Microsoft Visio, pages are either foreground or background pages. You can extract images from a particular page of a Visio file.

### Extract Images

The Page Class object represents the drawing area of a foreground page or a background page. The Shapes property exposed by the Diagram class supports a collection of Aspose.Diagram.Shape objects. This property can be used to extract all the images from a particular page.

#### Extract Images Programming Sample

The following piece of code extracts all images from a particular Visio page.

## Get Icons of Various Visio Shapes

Aspose.Diagram for Java API now allows developers to get icons of various Visio shapes. 

### Getting the Shape Icon

The code in the samples below show how to:

1.  Load an existing diagram or stencil.
2.  Get master by its index
3.  Get master icon. 
4.  Save icon to the local space.

#### Get Icons Programming Sample

## Replace a Picture Shape of the Visio Diagram

Aspose.Diagram for Java API allows developers to access and replace available picture shapes in the Visio diagram.

### Replacing a Picture Shape

The code in the samples below show how to:

1.  Load an existing diagram.
2.  Iterate through the selective page shapes.
3.  Apply filter to get picture shapes.
4.  Save resultant Visio diagram to the local space.

#### Replace a Picture Shape Programming Sample

## Import Bitmap Image as a Visio Shape

Aspose.Diagram for Java API now allows developers to import a bitmap image as a Microsoft Visio shape.

### Insert a BMP Image in Visio

The code in the samples below show how to:

1.  Create a diagram.
2.  Get Visio page
3.  Import a bitmap image as a Visio shape
4.  Save the diagram.

#### Insert a BMP Image Programming Sample

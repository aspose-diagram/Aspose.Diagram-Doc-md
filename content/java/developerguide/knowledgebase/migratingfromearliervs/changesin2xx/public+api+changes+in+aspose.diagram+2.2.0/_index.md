# Aspose.Diagram for Java : Public API Changes in Aspose.Diagram 2.2.0


This document describes changes to the Aspose.Diagram API from version 2.1.0 to 2.2.0, that may be of interest to module/application developers. It includes not only new and updated public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Diagram. 

### Adds two methods glueShapesInContainer and glueShapesInContainerByID to Page

The Page.glueShapesInContainer and Page.glueShapesInContainerByID methods have been added. These methods take connection IDs or Name / NameU as parameters to glue shapes in the container. You can see example topics about these features: [Glue Shapes Inside the Container](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=diagramjava&title=Glue+Shapes+Inside+the+Container&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=18612584)

### Overloaded method addMaster to Diagram

The overloaded Diagram.addMaster method has been added. It takes a master name and the source diagram object as parameters. Please find details of this feature in the following help topic: [Add Master from the Stencil of Shapes](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=diagramjava&title=Add+Master+from+the+Stencil+of+Shapes&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=18612584)

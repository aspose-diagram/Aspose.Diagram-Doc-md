## Modify Geometry Section of a Connector Shape

Any shape in Microsoft Office Visio is composed of one or more “geometries.” Each geometry represents a different component of the shape. Most shapes have just one geometry, but some have two or more. Aspose.Diagram APIs allow developers to manage these geometries programmatically.

The code snippets below manage geometries of a Shape.

### Programming Sample

The code snippets below manage geometries of a Shape.

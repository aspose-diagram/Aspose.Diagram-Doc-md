## Set Appearance of the Connector Type Shape in Visio

This topic elaborates how developers can change the appearance of dynamic connector type shape using Aspose.Diagram for Java.

### Set Connector Appearance

The `SetConnectorsType` method exposed by the [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/diagram/com.aspose.diagram/classes/shape) class can be used to set appearance of the connector type shape.

The code below shows how to:

1.  Load a sample diagram.
2.  get a particular page.
3.  get a particular connector shape.
4.  set appearance of the shape.
5.  save diagram

#### Set Connector Appearance Programming Sample

Use the following code in your Java application to set appearance of the connector type shape using Aspose.Diagram for Java.

## Select Reroute Option of the Connector Shape

The `ConFixedCode` property exposed by the [Layout](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/diagram/com.aspose.diagram/classes/layout) class can be used to select reroute option. The `Layout` property, exposed by the [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/diagram/com.aspose.diagram/classes/shape) class, will be used.

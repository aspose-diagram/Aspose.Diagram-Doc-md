## Installing Aspose.Diagram for Java from Aspose Repository

Aspose hosts all Java APIs on [Aspose Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-diagram). You can easily use Aspose.Diagram for Java API directly in your Maven projects with simple configurations.

### Specify Aspose Repository Configuration

First you need to specify Aspose Repository configuration / location in your Maven `pom.xml` as follows:

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>AsposeJavaAPI</id>
        <name>Aspose Java API</name>
        <url>http://repository.aspose.com/repo/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
{{< /code >}}

### Define Aspose.Diagram for Java API Dependency

Then define Aspose.Diagram for Java API dependency in your `pom.xml` as follows:

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
        <artifactId>aspose-diagram</artifactId>
        <version>19.9</version>
        <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
{{< /code >}}

After performing above steps, Aspose.Diagram for Java dependency will finally be defined in your Maven project.

## Introduction

### IntelliJ IDEA

**IntelliJ IDEA** is a Java integrated development environment (IDE) for software developers. It is developed by JetBrains. Originally created for Java, it currently supports a wide variety of languages, including JavaScript, Groovy, HTML, CSS, RSS, R, Haskell, PHP, Ruby, Python, Scala, Clojure, and Kotlin.

In a 2010 **Infoworld** report, IntelliJ received the highest test center score out of the four top Java programming tools: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans and Oracle JDeveloper.

### Aspose.Diagram for Java

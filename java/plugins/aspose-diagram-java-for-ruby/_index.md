## **Introduction**
### **Rjb - Ruby Java Bridge**
RJB is a bridge program that connect between Ruby and Java with Java Native Interface. Rake + Rjb is the more powerful and useful build tool than both Maven and Ant. You can test your Java business logic class itself with Rjb's mock. It helps to migrate Struts's Model Object into your RoR application. But beware to buildSwing application, Ruby (and Rjb) doesn't consider JVM's native threads handling.
### **Aspose.Diagram for Java**
Aspose.Diagram for Java is a Non-Graphical and well-structured API that allows developers to load an existing diagram, create a diagram from scratch, save a diagram in any supported file format and manipulate Microsoft Visio drawings within a Java application without using Microsoft Visio. It provides better performance and is easier to use to manipulate diagrams and convert files than Microsoft Office Automation.
### **Aspose.Diagram Java for Ruby**
Project Aspose.Diagram Java for Ruby shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Diagram Java APIs in Ruby. This project is aimed to provide useful examples for Ruby developers who want to utilize Aspose.Diagram for Java in their Ruby Projects using Rjb (Ruby Java Bridge).

## **Installation And Usage**
### **Installing**
It is very simple and easy to install Aspose.Diagram Java for Ruby gem, please follow the instructions:

Run following command.

{{< highlight java >}}

 $ gem install asposediagramjava

{{< /highlight >}}
### **Using**
Include the required files to export visio drawing to Pdf document.

{{< highlight java >}}

 require File.dirname(File.dirname(File.dirname(__FILE__))) + '/lib/asposediagramjava'

include Asposediagramjava

include Asposediagramjava::ExportToPdf

initialize_aspose_Diagram

{{< /highlight >}}

Let's understand the above code.

1. The first line makes sure that the Aspose.Diagram is loaded and available.
1. Include the files that are required to access the Aspose.Diagram
1. Initialize the libraries. The aspose Java classes are loaded from the path provided in the aspose.yml file
## **Support, Extend and Contribute**
### **Support**
From the very first days of Aspose, we knew that just giving our customers good products would not be enough. We also needed to deliver good service. We are developers ourselves and understand how frustrating it is when a technical issue or a quirk in the software stops you from doing what you need to do. We're here to solve problems, not create them.

This is why we offer free support. Anyone who uses our product, whether they have bought them or are using an evaluation, deserves our full attention and respect.
